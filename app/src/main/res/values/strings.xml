    <string name="text_about">A basic App that utilises the Rotten Tomatoes API to obtain a list of movies similar to the entered movie.\nIf the entered name is ambiguous, an initial list will be displayed to choose from. The selection from this list will then be used to used to query for a list of similar movies.\n\nNo calculations are done by the App, everything displayed is data returned by the Rotten Tomatoes API.\nNo data is saved by the App nor is a search history maintained.\n\nKnown Limitations:\n- As this is a public API, there are rate limits. Rates at the time of publishing are limited to 5 API calls per second and 10,000 calls per day.\n- Newer movies may not yield any results, this is dependant on Rotten Tomatoes updating their databases.\n\nOpen source project browsable on GitHub</string>
